<h4>Ongoing Development</h4>
<p>
Currently, Grebe aggregates geo-fenced Twitter data from provinces in Canada, including Alberta, Ontario, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Quebec. We have a repository of millions of tweets indexed from within Canada since July 2016. We are continuously expanding our platform to support new features, as well as aggregating social data from other provinces in Canada and other social data platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat.
