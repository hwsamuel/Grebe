<h4>On-going Development</h4>
<p>
Currently, Grebe aggregates geo-fenced Twitter data from provinces in Canada, including Alberta, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. We have a repository of over 2.5 million tweets (and counting) since July 2016. We are continuously expanding our platform to support new features, as well as aggregating social data from other provinces in Canada and other social data platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat.
